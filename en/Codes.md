Here I share some of my codes used in the previous works.

[Spectual method of solving 2D nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations in 2D circular region](https://github.com/zhaoyongfeng1990/spectral_solver)

To solve nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations of the form

$$\partial_t f_i=\sum_{k=1}^N\nabla\cdot(h_{ik}\nabla f_k)+g_i(f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_N)$$

in 2D circular region. But note it has unsolved divergence problem on the system boundary.

[Non-interacting run-and-tumble particles on 2D lattice, using continuous time Gillespie algorithm](https://github.com/zhaoyongfeng1990/2d_on_lattice)

I also have [an efficient version with Logistic population dynamics on site](https://github.com/zhaoyongfeng1990/2d_on_lattice_with_growth), and [a version with CUDA](https://github.com/zhaoyongfeng1990/2d_on_lattice_CUDA).

Extracting information of particle motion from high-speed timelapse images, based on a numerical inverse Laplace transformation of theoretical model prediction. For details please check my [PhD thesis]({{site.url}}/assets/Thesis_YongfengZhao.pdf)ã€‚
