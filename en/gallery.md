![N1 pde]({{site.url}}/assets/N1pattern_pde.png)![N1 lattice]({{site.url}}/assets/N1pattern.png)
{: refdef}
1D pattern formation of run-and-tumble particles with self-inhibition of motility. PDE simulation vs particle-based lattice simulation.

![2 species mutual activation]({{site.url}}/assets/MA_Montage.png)
{: refdef}
A segregating pattern formed by two populations of E. coli mutual activating the motility of each other, labeled in red and gree fluorescence. Each sector represents a different time point. Check the details in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0964-z)ã€‚

![3 species mutual activation]({{site.url}}/assets/3species_MA.png)
{: refdef}
Three species of active particles with mutual activation of motility.

![Dipole flow]({{site.url}}/assets/DipoleFlow.png)
{: refdef}
The current map of active Brownian particles created by a "kink" on the confining potential on the top. Check the details in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07738).
