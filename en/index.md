Welcom to my home page.

I'm now a postdoc working on active particles, and will sooner be a tenure-track associate professor in School of Physical Science and Technology, Soochow University. I work on non-equilibrium statistical physics of soft matter, nonlinear dynamics, and systems biology. I'm now in Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

I would be happy to share some of my research work, notes, ideas, and interesting things on this site.
