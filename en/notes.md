-----------------

This is a series of notes firstly written in my Zhihu (a Chinese Quora) blog, on courses of fundamental physics.

[Soft matter (non-equilibrium) statistical physics (Chinese)]({{site.url}}/assets/soft_matter.pdf)

On Langevin equation, Fokker-Planck equation, and relavent fundamental physics questions.

[General relativity (Chinese)]({{site.url}}/assets/general_relativity.pdf)

From elementary differential geometry to Einstein field equation, including simple introduction of Schwarzschild metric and Kerr metric.

[Non-relativistic quantum mechanics (Chinese)]({{site.url}}/assets/quantum_mechanics.pdf)

From Dirac symbols to elementary perturbation theory.

[Electrodynamics (Chinese)]({{site.url}}/assets/electrodynamics.pdf)

Maxwell equations, notation system of vector analysis, exterior derivative, and special relativity.

[Theoretical mechanics (Chinese)]({{site.url}}/assets/theoretical_mechanics.pdf)

Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics.
