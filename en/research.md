<h2>Active paticles</h2>

Active particles are particles that can propel the motion of itself. It is an useful concept to describe the macroscopic motion of bacteria, mammalian cells, birds, fishes, and even human beings. Systems of active particles are very common in the nature.

A group of active particles is a typical far-from-equilibrium system. Each particle consume "fuel" (e.g. ATP) to generate a driving force, and the energy is dissipated by the friction from the surronding fluids or substrates. Usually because of thermal fluctuations of the solvent, or interal dynamics of motors of particles, the orientations of particles cannot persist at large enough time. Thus the conservations of energy and momentum of particles are broken at the very microscopic level.

That's why active particles can have many complex behaviors compared to the passive systems. A group of aligning particles can form clusters and move collectively. Chiral active particles can form rotating vortex. Even the simplest active particles with force interactions can have liquid-gas-like phase separation and even form patterns. Due to their far-from-equilibrium nature, the world of active particles is very vast!
